         <h3>Directions</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Mix 1 tablespoon butter with brown sugar and gochujang in a small bowl to<br> form a paste; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add white sugar, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, egg,<br>and remaining 7 tablespoons butter into a bowl. Use an electric hand mixer, whisk,<br> or a spatula to mix everything until light and fluffy. Add flour; use a spatula to<br>mix until the flour disappears.</li>
            <li>Flatten mixture in the bowl with the flat side of the spatula, then slightly<br>roughen the surface with the edge of the spatula to make some shallow cracks<br>and crevices.</li>
            <li>Use a teaspoon to apply small dollops of gochujang mixture over the top, then <br>use the spatula to fold cookie dough up over the gochujang mixture, gently <br>stirring and folding, to create well-defined streaks of chili paste marbled <br>throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate dough for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with <br>parchment.</li>
            <li>Scoop cookie dough by 2 tablespoonfuls; arrange 8 cookies per pan on the <br>prepared baking sheet, leaving plenty of room between cookies; dough will <br>spread out.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are very lightly golden, 13 to 15 <br>minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool <br>completely.</li>
