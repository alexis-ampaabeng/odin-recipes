         <p>The secret to this 4 ingredient lemon pound cake is sweetened condensed milk. Dense but moist, it makes a <br>great base for strawberry shortcake. When served by itself, top it with a simple lemon juice and powdered <br>sugar glaze.</p>

         <h2>Directions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan <br>with nonstick spray, line bottom and sides with parchment paper, and spray <br>again with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out <br> clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before removing from <br> the pan.</li>
