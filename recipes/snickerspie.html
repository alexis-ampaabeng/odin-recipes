         <p>This no-bake Snickers pie tastes just like the Snickers bar you know and love-caramel, peanuts, and chocolate, but in a fluffy, creamy pie. Roasted, salted peanuts in the graham cracker crust add delightful crunch and salt.</p>

         <h2>Directions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>For crust: place crackers, 1/4 cup peanuts, and brown sugar in the bowl of a food processor and process until crushed into very fine crumbs, about 45 seconds. With the processor running, pour melted butter through food chute; process until well combined, about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to an ungreased 9-inch pie plate; press crumbs evenly into bottom and up the sides of pie plate. Freeze, uncovered, until crust is hardened, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make filling: beat cream cheese, peanut butter, and 6 tablespoons caramel sauce in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until very smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add powdered sugar, and beat on low speed until smooth and fluffy, about 10 seconds. Carefully fold whipped topping into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions, folding until mixture is homogeneous and well combined. Fold in the 1 1/2 cups finely chopped nougat bars until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining 2 tablespoons caramel sauce evenly over bottom of chilled crust.</li>
            <li>Transfer filling into crust, smooth into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator until filling is completely firm, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Before serving, drizzle with chocolate syrup and caramel sauce. Sprinkle evenly with the 1/3 cup chopped nougat bars and peanuts. Return to the freezer until sauce is set, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
